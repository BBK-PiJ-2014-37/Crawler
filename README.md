Coursework assignment 5 - A web crawler
The program must be called with two parameters:

maxDepth: the max level to crawl

url: the url to start with

For instance:

java webCrawler 3 "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler"

I implemented the Queue on top on a file and the Set on top of a Derby database table.
